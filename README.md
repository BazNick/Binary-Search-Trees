# Binary-Search-Trees
Tasks:
1. Write a program to display the contents of a binary tree. Can you write a program that prints the
nodes in a binary tree in sorted order? What about in reverse sorted order?
2. Write a program that counts the number of nodes in a binary tree.
3. Write a program that checks whether a binary tree is properly balanced.
4. Write a program that checks if the binary tree is properly sorted so that all nodes to the left of a given
node are less than the value of that node, and all nodes to the right are greater than the value of that
node.
